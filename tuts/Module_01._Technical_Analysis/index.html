<h1>Module 01. Technical Analysis of financial markets</h1>
<div class="jumbotron">
  <h1 class="display-4">Why Technical Analysis ?</h1>
  <p class="lead">Most traders swear by Technical Analysis but some long-term investors dispute it's importance and consider movement of markets as a random-walk and consider Technical Analysis akin to reading tea leaves.</p>
  <hr class="my-4">
  <p>We believe that:
    <ol>
      <li>
        Technical Analysis provides clues to the behaviour of markets. We use these clues along with fundamental analysis and we put our faith in balancing your portfolio and risk. There is an old quote from economist John Maynard Keynes <em>"The
          market can remain
          irrational longer than you can remain solvent"</em>. So we give the market it's space to be irrational, throw tantrums, show animal spirits and be the immature kid. There's always a night after a long day howsoever long the day might feel
        like; and there's always a day after a long night.
      </li>
      <li>
        Markets look like madness, but there is a method to it's madness. Sometimes one understands the madness, and those are times when Technical Analysis proves correct, while sometimes one is not able to understand the madness and those times
        Technical Analysis is proven incorrect. But, not doing technical analysis is to some extent like living in the 16th century; relying of God rather than science to look into diseases.
      </li>
      <li>
        Markets are an information game, and the thing about information is that it's not evenly distributed. Sometimes, you may just not know something that you need to know. Technical Analysis crutial in deciphering these situations.
